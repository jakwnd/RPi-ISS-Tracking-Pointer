Raspberry Pi I.S.S. Tracking Pointer
---

Inspired by [gradphys I.S.S. Tracking Pointer](https://github.com/gradyh/ISS-Tracking-Pointer). But built for a Raspberry Pi and built with 3D printed parts. I wanted to use the RPi for the network connection and utilize online tracking API's to download coordinates, but also have the option of using the tracking algorithm when a network is not available.
